## Summary:
The purpose of this project is to help the individual minimize their impact through increased accountability in your shower habits.  Utilizing the IoT with an AdaFruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, coupled with a DHT-22 humidity and temperature sensor, we created a humidity sensor app that is able to read and track humidity produced from a shower.

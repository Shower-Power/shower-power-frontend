## Summary:
The purpose of this project is to help the individual minimize their environmental impact through increased accountability in their showering habits.  Utilizing the IoT with an AdaFruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, coupled with a DHT-22 humidity and temperature sensor, we created a temperature/humidity sensor app that is able to read and track the increased temperature and humidity produced from a shower. We also track shower length to help the individual monitor their water use.
